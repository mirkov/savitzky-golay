	* savitzky-golay-package-def.lisp (#:savitzky-golay): Removed
	import of map-grid-utils symbols

	* savitzky-golay.asd (#:savitzky-golay): Removed dependence on
	map-grid-utils

	* gram-poly.lisp (weight-1): Fixed up summation index name that
	got mangled during variable renaming.

	* matrix.lisp (c-n): Renamed n into i, n-l into l, n-r into r
	(matrix-coeffs): Renamed c-coeffs into matrix-coeffs.  Minor edits
	to the routine
	(make-design-matrix, matrix-coeffs): Renamed n-l into l, n-r into r
	(matrix-coeffs, c-n): Renamed l-d into s

	* convolution-vector.lisp (convolution-vector): Variable renaming,
	and more code to make it conformal to new naming convention and
	filter-coeffs
	(make-convolution-vector): Renamed some variables

	* savitzky-golay.asd (#:savitzky-golay): Added dependency on
	map-grid-utils
	(#:savitzky-golay): Added more components due to refactoring

	* savitzky-golay-package-def.lisp (#:savitzky-golay): package uses
	map-grid-utils

	* matrix.lisp (c-coeffs): Changed variable name m to k

	* README.org: Updating to generalize and include gram-poly

	* savitzky-golay.asd (#:savitzky-golay): Added "gram-poly" to
	component list

	* gram-poly.lisp: New file

	* savitzky-golay-coeffs.lisp (c-coeffs): Fixed bugs in assertion
	tests

2013-09-08  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* README.org: Updated documentation for make-convolution-vector

	* savitzky-golay-coeffs.lisp (make-convolution-vector): Added
	additional return value, (max n-l n-r)
