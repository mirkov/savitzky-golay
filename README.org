#+title: Savitzky-Golay filters and convolution vectors



* Aim
  This package calculates Savizky-Golay filters and packages them in
  vectors suitable for convolution

* Method
  I use the discussion [[http://www.wire.tu-bs.de/OLDWEB/mameyer/cmr/savgol.pdf][Section 14.8]] of Numerical Recipes in C (2nd
  Edition) to develop the code.  However, instead of using the matrix
  inverse method as the text and code suggest, I solve for the vector
  c-n.
  
  GSLL is used for linear algebra computations.  There is no reason
  for not using [[https://github.com/tpapp/lla][LLA]], except that I have not installed that library on
  my systems.

** /Function/ *c-coeffs*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       sf2f72z0c8g0
   :END:

*** Syntax:
    *c-coeffs* /n-l n-r m &optional l-d reverse/ => /c-coeffs n-c n-r/

*** Arguments and values
    - /n-l/ -- non-negative integer
    - /n-r/ -- non-negative integer
    - /m/ -- non-negative integer, m >= n-l + n-r
    - /l-d/ -- non-negative integer, l-d <= m
    - /reverse/ -- generalized boolean, default /T/
    - /c-coeffs/ -- list of Savizsky-Golay coefficients
    - /n-c/ -- non-negative integer, n-c = 1 + n-l + n-r

*** Description
    Return list of Savitzky-Golay filter coefficients for /n-l/
    leftward (past) points, /n-r/ rightward (future) points.  /m/ is
    the order of the polynomial, and /l-d/ the derivative order.

    If /reverse/ is T, the coefficients are returned in reverse
    order, starting from index /n-r/, /n-r/-1 ,...,1,0,-1,-2,..., -
    /n-l/.



** /Function/ *make-convolution-vector*

   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       0uzae6z0c8g0
   :END:
*** Syntax:
    *make-convolution-vector* /n-p c-coeffs n-c n-r/ => /foreign-vector/

*** Arguments and values
    - /n-p/ -- positive integer, /n-p >= n=c/
    - /c-coeffs/ -- list of Savitzky Golay coefficients in reverse order
    - /n-c/ -- positive integer, length of /c-coeffs/
    - /n-r/ -- non-negative integer
    - /foreign-vector/ -- A foreign vector of length /n-p/, holding
      double-floats

*** Description
    Package Savizky-Golay coefficients provided in C-COEFFS into a
    foreign vector of length /n-p/ suitable for convolution.  The
    coefficients are stored in reverse order, meaning the rightward's
    one are at the end of the vector, and the leftward's ones at the
    beginning of the vector.

    The values /n-c/ and /n-r/ are returned by a prior call to
    [[id:sf2f72z0c8g0][c-coeffs]].
    

** /Function/ *convolution-vector*

*** Syntax:
    *convolution-vector* /n-p n-p n-l n-r m &optional l-d/ => /foreign-vector/

*** Arguments and values
    - /n-p/ -- positive integer, /n-p >= n=c/
    - /n-l/ -- non-negative integer
    - /n-r/ -- non-negative integer
    - /m/ -- non-negative integer, m >= n-l + n-r
    - /l-d/ -- non-negative integer, l-d <= m
    - /foreign-vector/ -- A foreign vector of length /n-p/, holding
      double-floats

*** Description
    Wrapper routine for calls to  [[id:sf2f72z0c8g0][*c-coeffs*]] and
    [[id:0uzae6z0c8g0][*make-convolution-vector*]].  Given parameters of Savizky-Golay
    filters, return a vector of length /n-p/ suitable for convolution.
